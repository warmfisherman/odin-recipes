    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One of the five mother sauces. Pretty easy stuff.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Spices, as preferred</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan set to medium heat, melt the butter</li>
        <li>Once the butter is melted, slowly add the volumetric equivalent of flour, stirring as added</li>
        <li>Continue to stir the butter and flour together until homogenous; this is the roux</li>
        <li>Continue stirring the roux until it emits a light nutty smell (it should be a light golden color)</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and slowly add milk, whisking as added</li>
        <li>The milk will evaporate as you stir. At this point, you can continue to add milk and stir to achieve your desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Once desired thickness is achieved, season with salt to taste. Season with additional spices as desired. </li>
    </ol>
